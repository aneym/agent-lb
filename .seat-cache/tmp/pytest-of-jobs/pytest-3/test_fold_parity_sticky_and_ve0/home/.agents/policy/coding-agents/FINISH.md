## Finish (appended by the launcher; do not remove)

- Work only in the worktree the brief names and, for local seats, the calling lane's own directory as scoped below. Do not merge, push or move other branches unless the brief says to land.
- Edit only the files the brief lists. Never edit the check or a scenario. Local seats may edit the calling lane's own directory and the lane's named worktrees, including brief-listed evidence, state, lane-local helpers and runners. Resolve the own lane from `LANE_DIR`, or the brief's `Lane: <name>` / `Lane <name>` line. Never edit lanes other than your own, ~/.agent-rails/factory state, scoping state or Alex's files. If the own lane cannot be resolved, no lane-directory edits are allowed. Do not skip, delete or weaken tests, and add no `|| true` or continue-on-error.
- Run the brief's check yourself and quote its last lines. The runner reruns it after you exit and fails the slice if your diff weakens it.
- UI changes: boot the app with `boot <worktree> --json`, take light and dark, desktop and phone shots with `page-shot <url> --out <dir>`, and list the PNG paths under artifacts.
- Ask nothing: nobody will answer. If the spec is unclear or you are blocked, stop and report status "blocked".
- End your reply with exactly one block in this shape, the JSON on the single line between the markers:

HANDOFF
{"status": "done", "done": [], "deviations": [], "concerns": [], "findings": [], "unverified": [], "files": [], "check": {"cmd": "", "rc": 0}, "artifacts": []}
END HANDOFF

status is done, blocked or failed. unverified lists what you could not check.
