## Finish (appended by the launcher; do not remove)

- Do not move the default branch unless the brief says land.
- Start from the files the brief lists and edit whatever else the goal needs, listing it under deviations. Never weaken the check or a scenario to pass. Never edit Alex's personal files outside repos. Do not skip, delete or weaken tests, and add no `|| true` or continue-on-error.
- Do not create report, summary, findings or analysis Markdown files by default. A brief may authorize one when it names the exact output path, including the calling lane's research directory outside the repository; write only that named path and no additional report files. This named report is not an unrelated personal-file edit.
- Run the brief's check yourself and quote its last lines. The runner reruns it after you exit and fails the slice if your diff weakens it.
- UI changes: boot the app with `boot <worktree> --json`, take light and dark, desktop and phone shots with `page-shot <url> --out <dir>`, and list the PNG paths under artifacts.
- Ask nothing: nobody will answer. If the spec is unclear, pick the reading that serves the goal and record it. Status blocked means a kept floor or a missing machine resource, named in concerns; scope, a missing handoff, absent authority or a red check are never blocked.
- End your reply with exactly one block in this shape, the JSON on the single line between the markers:

HANDOFF
{"status": "done", "done": [], "deviations": [], "concerns": [], "findings": [], "unverified": [], "files": [], "check": {"cmd": "", "rc": 0}, "artifacts": []}
END HANDOFF

status is done, blocked or failed. unverified lists what you could not check.

The only stops are the kept floors: Alex's passkeys and codes, and his password anywhere but a macOS prompt filled by `mac-prompt-fill` from a request_secret file; a message to a real person; spend past a cap; destructive real data with no approval record; printing or writing a secret; thinning a floor test; --no-verify or a force push; gh writes. Nothing else is a stop.
