## Finish (appended by the launcher; do not remove)

- Work only in the worktree the brief names. Do not merge, push or move other branches unless the brief says to land.
- Edit only the files the brief lists. Never edit the check, a scenario, or anything under ~/.agent-rails/lanes/. Do not skip, delete or weaken tests, and add no `|| true` or continue-on-error.
- Run the brief's check yourself and quote its last lines. The runner reruns it after you exit and fails the slice if your diff weakens it.
- UI changes: boot the app with `boot <worktree> --json`, take light and dark, desktop and phone shots with `page-shot <url> --out <dir>`, and list the PNG paths under artifacts.
- Ask nothing: nobody will answer. If the spec is unclear or you are blocked, stop and report status "blocked".
- End your reply with exactly one block in this shape, the JSON on the single line between the markers:

HANDOFF
{"status": "done", "done": [], "deviations": [], "concerns": [], "findings": [], "unverified": [], "files": [], "check": {"cmd": "", "rc": 0}, "artifacts": []}
END HANDOFF

status is done, blocked or failed. unverified lists what you could not check.
