# responses-api-compat Specification

## Purpose

Define Responses API compatibility contracts so Codex, OpenCode, and OpenAI-style clients preserve expected behavior.

Requirements continue in these capability specs:

- [responses-api-compat-request-shape](../responses-api-compat-request-shape/spec.md): accepted request shapes, payload sanitation, tools and file inputs
- [responses-api-compat-streaming](../responses-api-compat-streaming/spec.md): public SSE event contract, terminal output and tool-call events
- [responses-api-compat-continuity](../responses-api-compat-continuity/spec.md): previous-response continuity, session affinity and websocket error shapes
- [responses-api-compat-compaction](../responses-api-compat-compaction/spec.md): remote compaction output and envelopes
- [responses-api-compat-transport](../responses-api-compat-transport/spec.md): upstream transport strategy, websocket drops, overload and HTTP bridge sessions
- [responses-api-compat-stream-timeouts](../responses-api-compat-stream-timeouts/spec.md): stream deadlines, liveness frames and heartbeats

## Requirements

### Requirement: Use prompt_cache_key as OpenAI cache affinity
For OpenAI-style `/v1/responses`, `/v1/responses/compact`, and chat-completions requests mapped onto Responses, the service MUST treat a non-empty `prompt_cache_key` as the bounded upstream account affinity key for prompt-cache correctness even when a `session_id` header is present. OpenAI-style route wiring MUST NOT upgrade those requests to durable `CODEX_SESSION` affinity by default. This affinity MUST apply even when dashboard `sticky_threads_enabled` is disabled, the service MUST continue forwarding the same `prompt_cache_key` upstream unchanged, and the stored affinity MUST expire after the configured freshness window so older keys can rebalance. The freshness window MUST come from dashboard settings so operators can adjust it without restart.

#### Scenario: OpenAI-style route ignores session header for durable codex-session pinning
- **WHEN** a client sends `/v1/responses` or `/v1/responses/compact` with a non-empty `session_id` header and no explicit sticky-thread mode
- **THEN** the service does not persist a durable `codex_session` mapping solely from that header
- **AND** bounded prompt-cache affinity behavior remains in effect

#### Scenario: dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL is applied
- **WHEN** an operator updates the dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL
- **THEN** subsequent OpenAI-style prompt-cache affinity decisions use the new freshness window

### Requirement: Requested and actual fast-tier observability
Compatibility request logs MUST record requested priority separately from the actual upstream service tier and MUST NOT label default-tier execution as fast.

#### Scenario: Priority degrades to default
- **WHEN** the request asks for priority and upstream reports default
- **THEN** logs show requested `priority`, actual `default`, and billable tier according to existing accounting rules

#### Scenario: in-flight bridge follower loses continuity while waiting on the same canonical session
- **WHEN** a follow-up request waits on an in-flight HTTP bridge session for the same hard continuity key
- **AND** the bridge still cannot reconstruct safe continuity state once the leader finishes
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** the error code is not `previous_response_not_found`

#### Scenario: multiplexed follow-ups fail closed only for the matching continuity anchor
- **WHEN** a websocket or HTTP bridge session has multiple pending follow-up requests with different `previous_response_id` anchors
- **AND** continuity loss is detected for exactly one of those anchors
- **THEN** the service applies the retryable fail-closed continuity error only to the matching follow-up request
- **AND** it does not expose raw `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** unrelated pending requests continue on their own response lifecycle

#### Scenario: multiplexed follow-ups sharing one anchor fail closed together without leaking raw continuity errors
- **WHEN** a websocket or HTTP bridge session has multiple pending follow-up requests that share the same `previous_response_id` anchor
- **AND** upstream emits an anonymous continuity loss event such as `previous_response_not_found` for that shared anchor
- **THEN** the service rewrites each affected follow-up into a retryable continuity error
- **AND** no affected follow-up exposes raw `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the run remains usable for subsequent requests after the rewritten failures

#### Scenario: single pre-created follow-up still fails closed when continuity loss omits explicit response id in message
- **WHEN** a websocket follow-up request is pending with `previous_response_id` and has not received a stable upstream `response.id` yet
- **AND** upstream emits `previous_response_not_found` with `param=previous_response_id`
- **AND** the upstream error message omits the literal previous response identifier
- **THEN** the service still maps that continuity loss to the pending follow-up
- **AND** it rewrites the downstream terminal event to a retryable continuity error
- **AND** it does not surface raw `previous_response_not_found` to the client

### Requirement: Request logs persist requested, actual, and billable service tiers separately
For Responses proxy traffic, the system MUST persist the operator-requested tier, the upstream-reported actual tier when available, and the effective billable tier used for pricing as separate request-log fields.

The legacy `fast` alias MUST be normalized to the canonical upstream value
`priority` before forwarding and before it is stored as the requested tier.
The upstream-reported `response.service_tier`, when present, remains the
authoritative actual tier even when it differs from the requested tier.

#### Scenario: Upstream reports a downgraded actual tier
- **WHEN** a client sends a Responses request with `service_tier: "priority"`
- **AND** the upstream response later reports `service_tier: "default"`
- **THEN** the persisted request log entry records `requested_service_tier = "priority"`
- **AND** the persisted request log entry records `actual_service_tier = "default"`
- **AND** the persisted request log entry records billable `service_tier = "default"`

#### Scenario: Fast alias is logged as a priority request
- **WHEN** a client sends a Responses request with `service_tier: "fast"`
- **AND** the upstream response later reports `service_tier: "default"`
- **THEN** the persisted request log entry records `requested_service_tier = "priority"`
- **AND** the persisted request log entry records `actual_service_tier = "default"`
- **AND** the persisted request log entry records billable `service_tier = "default"`

#### Scenario: Upstream omits the actual tier
- **WHEN** a client sends a Responses request with `service_tier: "priority"`
- **AND** the upstream response omits `service_tier`
- **THEN** the persisted request log entry records `requested_service_tier = "priority"`
- **AND** the persisted request log entry records `actual_service_tier = null`
- **AND** the persisted request log entry records billable `service_tier = "priority"`

### Requirement: API key service tier enforcement applies to upstream Responses requests

When an API key carries an enforced service tier, the proxy MUST override any incoming Responses request service tier with that enforced value before forwarding upstream. The legacy alias `fast` MUST be treated as `priority`.

#### Scenario: Enforced service tier overrides the request payload

- **WHEN** an API key is configured with `enforcedServiceTier: "priority"`
- **AND** an incoming Responses request asks for `service_tier: "default"`
- **THEN** the forwarded upstream payload uses `service_tier: "priority"`

#### Scenario: Fast alias is applied as priority

- **WHEN** an API key is configured with `enforcedServiceTier: "fast"`
- **THEN** the forwarded upstream payload uses the canonical value `priority`

### Requirement: Responses routing prefers budget-safe accounts
When serving Responses routes, the service MUST prefer eligible accounts that are still below the configured budget threshold over eligible accounts already above that threshold. If no below-threshold candidate exists, the service MAY fall back to the pressured candidates.

#### Scenario: Fresh Responses request avoids a near-exhausted account
- **WHEN** `/backend-api/codex/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses/compact`, `/v1/responses`, or `/v1/responses/compact` selects among multiple eligible active accounts
- **AND** one candidate is above the configured budget threshold
- **AND** another candidate remains below that threshold
- **THEN** the below-threshold candidate is chosen first

### Requirement: Proxy-generated prompt cache key derivation is operator-toggleable
The service MUST provide a runtime flag that disables only proxy-generated prompt-cache-key derivation. When disabled, the service MUST continue forwarding any client-supplied `prompt_cache_key` unchanged and MUST NOT synthesize a new one.

#### Scenario: Derivation disabled preserves client-supplied key
- **WHEN** the derivation flag is disabled and a client sends `prompt_cache_key`
- **THEN** the service forwards that key unchanged
- **AND** it does not generate a replacement key

### Requirement: Responses account selection accounts for in-flight pressure

For Responses API requests, usage-based routing MUST include immediate in-process account pressure in addition to persisted usage. Account selection MUST account for in-flight response-create work, active streams, leased token/cost estimates, recent selection pressure, account health, and enabled account-local caps. Selection and lease acquisition MUST be atomic with respect to other in-process selections, and the critical section MUST NOT perform database calls, network calls, sleeps, or other blocking I/O. Active response-create and stream leases MUST remain routing pressure signals when the matching account-local cap is `0`.

#### Scenario: Concurrent burst spreads before upstream usage refreshes

- **GIVEN** multiple eligible accounts have similar persisted usage
- **WHEN** many `/v1/responses` requests arrive concurrently before upstream usage refreshes
- **THEN** selected accounts are distributed according to immediate in-flight pressure and enabled caps
- **AND** one account does not receive all requests solely because persisted usage was stale

#### Scenario: Uncapped response-create leases remain pressure

- **GIVEN** the account response-create cap is unset or configured as `0`
- **AND** in-flight response-create work exists on an eligible account
- **WHEN** a new `/v1/responses` request is routed
- **THEN** the account remains eligible for selection
- **AND** the in-flight response-create work still contributes to pressure scoring

#### Scenario: File-pinned bridge request does not reroute under local pressure

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge `/v1/responses` request references an `input_file.file_id` pinned to an upstream account
- **AND** that owner account or bridge session rejects admission with local pressure before output starts
- **WHEN** the proxy handles the admission failure
- **THEN** it returns the owner account overload instead of soft-rerouting the payload to another account
- **AND** the file-scoped request is not replayed to an account that does not own the file

#### Scenario: Runtime lock excludes blocking I/O

- **WHEN** account selection holds the balancer runtime lock
- **THEN** the implementation performs only in-memory scoring and lease mutation
- **AND** database, network, sleep, or bridge queue waits happen outside that lock

### Requirement: Account leases release on all terminal paths

Every account-local lease acquired for a Responses request MUST be idempotently released or settled on success, upstream error, local startup error, bridge submit failure, startup probe conversion, non-streaming collect completion, failover, downstream disconnect, cancellation, timeout, and retry. A bounded stale-lease watchdog MUST reclaim leases that survive unexpected task cancellation or exceptions, and stale reclamation MUST emit warning/metric evidence. Leases MUST NOT be persisted to the database.

#### Scenario: Lease releases after downstream disconnect

- **WHEN** a streaming `/v1/responses` client disconnects before a terminal upstream event
- **THEN** the account stream lease is released exactly once
- **AND** later routing pressure no longer includes that stream

#### Scenario: WebSocket local account cap releases API-key reservation

- **GIVEN** a WebSocket `response.create` has reserved API-key usage
- **AND** account-local response-create lease acquisition fails with `account_response_create_cap`
- **WHEN** the proxy emits the local terminal failure
- **THEN** the API-key usage reservation is released
- **AND** the pending request is removed from websocket local state

#### Scenario: Stale watchdog recovers orphaned lease

- **WHEN** a request task exits unexpectedly after acquiring an account lease
- **AND** the lease exceeds the configured TTL
- **THEN** the watchdog releases the stale lease
- **AND** emits a low-cardinality warning/metric

#### Scenario: Active stream lease is not reclaimed before valid stream budget

- **GIVEN** a stream lease is older than the base lease TTL
- **AND** the configured Responses stream or HTTP bridge request budget has not elapsed
- **WHEN** account lease stale reclamation runs
- **THEN** the stream lease still counts against account-local stream pressure
- **AND** the proxy does not admit extra streams over the account stream cap by age alone

### Requirement: Compact auth failures fail over after forced refresh

The proxy MUST recover from account-local compact authentication failures before
surfacing them to the compact client. When a `/backend-api/codex/responses/compact`
request receives an upstream `401 invalid_api_key` response for the selected
account, the proxy MUST attempt one forced token refresh and retry the compact
request on that same account. If the refreshed retry also returns `401`, the
proxy MUST classify and record the account failure, exclude that account from
the current compact request, and try another eligible account when one is
available. The proxy MUST NOT surface the repeated account-local `401` to the
compact client before exhausting eligible accounts.

#### Scenario: Refreshed compact auth failure uses another account

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for a compact request
- **AND** the selected account returns `401 invalid_api_key` for compact before and after a forced refresh
- **WHEN** another eligible account can complete the compact request
- **THEN** the downstream compact response succeeds from the second account
- **AND** the selected account is excluded from further attempts for that compact request

#### Scenario: Compact 401 is not a generic same-contract retry

- **WHEN** low-level compact transport receives HTTP 401 from upstream
- **THEN** the service-level auth refresh/failover path handles it
- **AND** the low-level compact transport does not mark it as a generic same-contract transport retry

### Requirement: Pre-visible proxy auth failures fail over after forced refresh

The proxy MUST treat repeated account-local authentication failures as
per-request account failures before any downstream-visible output is emitted.
When a proxy request on a non-compact surface retries with a refreshed token and
the refreshed retry still returns upstream `401 invalid_api_key`, the proxy MUST
classify and record the selected account failure, exclude that account from the
current request, and try another eligible account when one is available. The
proxy MUST preserve the existing no-replay rule after downstream-visible stream
or websocket output has been emitted.

#### Scenario: Pre-visible streaming auth failure uses another account

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for a streaming responses request
- **AND** the selected account returns `401 invalid_api_key` before downstream-visible output
- **WHEN** another eligible account can complete the request
- **THEN** the downstream stream succeeds from another account
- **AND** the selected account is excluded from further attempts for that request

#### Scenario: Non-stream proxy auth failure uses another account

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for a thread-goal, Codex control,
  transcription, or file create/finalize request
- **AND** the selected account returns `401 invalid_api_key` before and after a forced refresh
- **WHEN** another eligible account can complete the request
- **THEN** the downstream request succeeds from another account
- **AND** the selected account is excluded from further attempts for that request

#### Scenario: Websocket connect auth failure uses another account

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for an upstream websocket connect
- **AND** the selected account returns `401 invalid_api_key` after a forced refresh retry
- **WHEN** another eligible account can open the upstream websocket
- **THEN** the websocket connect path excludes the invalidated account and tries another account

#### Scenario: HTTP bridge handshake auth failure uses another account

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for HTTP bridge session creation or reconnect
- **AND** the selected account returns `401 invalid_api_key` after a forced refresh retry
- **WHEN** another eligible account can open the upstream websocket handshake
- **THEN** the HTTP bridge path excludes the invalidated account and tries another account
