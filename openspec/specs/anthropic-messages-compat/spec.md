# anthropic-messages-compat Specification

## Purpose

Define Anthropic Messages API compatibility contracts so Claude Code and direct Anthropic clients can use both client-defined and Anthropic-defined tools through agent-lb without protocol rewriting.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Anthropic Messages accepts custom and defined tool declarations

The service MUST accept client-defined Anthropic tools that provide `name` and `input_schema`. The service MUST also accept Anthropic-defined tools that provide a versioned `type` and `name` without requiring `input_schema`. Accepted tool declarations and their optional fields MUST be forwarded upstream without changing the caller-selected tool type.

#### Scenario: Existing custom tool remains valid

- **WHEN** a client sends `/v1/messages` with a tool containing `name`, `description`, and `input_schema`
- **THEN** the service accepts the request and forwards the custom tool fields upstream

#### Scenario: Basic web search server tool is accepted

- **WHEN** a client sends `/v1/messages` with `{"type":"web_search_20250305","name":"web_search"}`
- **THEN** the service accepts the request without requiring `input_schema`
- **AND** forwards `type` and `name` unchanged

#### Scenario: Dynamic-filtering web search server tool is accepted

- **WHEN** a client sends `/v1/messages` with `{"type":"web_search_20260209","name":"web_search"}` and supported optional fields
- **THEN** the service accepts the request without requiring `input_schema`
- **AND** forwards the selected type and optional fields unchanged

### Requirement: Anthropic server-tool responses remain protocol transparent

The service MUST preserve Anthropic server-tool streaming and non-streaming response bodies on the downstream `/v1/messages` connection. Internal usage extraction MUST NOT remove or rewrite server-tool use or result blocks.

#### Scenario: Web search stream passes through

- **WHEN** Anthropic returns server-tool use and web-search result events for an accepted request
- **THEN** the downstream client receives those events unchanged and in upstream order
