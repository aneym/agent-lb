# runtime-portability Specification

## Purpose

Define runtime portability contracts so resilience features degrade safely across supported operating systems.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Memory monitor startup remains portable across supported platforms

The resilience memory monitor MUST NOT prevent application startup on platforms where Unix-specific standard-library modules are unavailable. The system MUST resolve RSS measurement through a platform-appropriate provider when one exists, and MUST fall back to treating memory pressure telemetry as unavailable instead of crashing when no provider is available.

#### Scenario: Windows startup does not import Unix-only resource module

- **WHEN** the application starts on Windows
- **AND** the Python runtime does not provide the Unix-only `resource` module
- **THEN** the memory monitor imports successfully
- **AND** application startup continues without `ModuleNotFoundError`

#### Scenario: RSS provider unavailable does not crash request handling

- **WHEN** the memory monitor cannot resolve RSS from `psutil`, a platform API, or `resource`
- **THEN** RSS lookup returns an unavailable result without raising to callers
- **AND** memory warning and rejection checks do not crash request handling

### Requirement: Codex session provider retag CLI

The `agent-lb` CLI SHALL provide a `codex-sessions retag` subcommand that rewrites local Codex session metadata from one supported model provider tag to another supported model provider tag. The command MUST support `openai` and `agent-lb` provider tags, MUST reject unknown providers, and MUST reject retag requests where `--from` and `--to` are the same provider.

#### Scenario: Dry run previews JSONL and SQLite changes without writing

- **WHEN** an operator runs `agent-lb codex-sessions retag --from openai --to agent-lb --dry-run`
- **THEN** the command scans JSONL session files under the selected Codex home
- **AND** it scans `state_*.sqlite` databases that contain a `threads.model_provider` column
- **AND** it reports the matching files and rows
- **AND** it does not create backups or mutate session metadata

#### Scenario: Confirmed retag updates both storage formats with backup

- **WHEN** an operator runs `agent-lb codex-sessions retag --from openai --to agent-lb --yes`
- **THEN** matched JSONL session provider tags are rewritten to `agent-lb`
- **AND** matched SQLite `threads.model_provider` rows are rewritten to `agent-lb`
- **AND** the command creates a backup under the selected Codex home before rewriting matched metadata
- **AND** the command reports a summary of scanned and updated JSONL files and SQLite rows

#### Scenario: Non-interactive writes require explicit confirmation

- **WHEN** the command is run in a non-interactive shell without `--dry-run` and without `--yes`
- **THEN** it refuses to write session metadata
- **AND** it exits with an error explaining that `--yes` is required

#### Scenario: Codex home resolves across host runtimes

- **WHEN** `--codex-home` is provided
- **THEN** the command uses that path as the Codex data directory
- **AND** otherwise it falls back to `CODEX_HOME`, `/codex-home` in containers, a discoverable WSL Windows profile Codex directory, or `~/.codex`

### Requirement: Portable ccgpt command
Supported local installations SHALL expose an executable `ccgpt` command or documented shell function backed by the repository launcher, without hardcoding secrets.

#### Scenario: Installed command
- **WHEN** agent-lb is installed and Claude Code is present
- **THEN** `ccgpt --version` or a dry run resolves the real Claude binary and the local compatibility capability

#### Scenario: Missing Claude Code
- **WHEN** the Claude binary cannot be resolved
- **THEN** `ccgpt` fails with a clear nonzero diagnostic

### Requirement: Launcher shim rides out load-balancer recovery windows

The `claude-lb-launch` intercepting shim MUST retry connection-level agent-lb
failures (refused, reset, broken pipe — errors where no HTTP response was
produced) with bounded backoff for a default budget of at least 100 seconds,
so that a watchdog-driven service recovery (~65s worst case) never surfaces a
connection error to the agent. Real HTTP responses MUST NOT be retried. Direct
first-party Anthropic auxiliary requests MUST NOT use this local-service
recovery budget. The budget MUST remain overridable via `CLAUDE_LB_SHIM_CONNECT_RETRIES`,
`CLAUDE_LB_SHIM_CONNECT_BACKOFF`, and `CLAUDE_LB_SHIM_CONNECT_BACKOFF_CAP`.
The same proxy implementation MUST support both a launcher-owned ephemeral
port that exits with its parent and an explicitly selected fixed loopback port
that remains alive without a parent watcher.

#### Scenario: LB restarts mid-session

- **GIVEN** an agent session proxied through the shim
- **WHEN** agent-lb is unavailable for up to 100 seconds
- **THEN** the shim keeps retrying the request and completes it once the
  service is back, without surfacing a 502 to the agent

#### Scenario: Real HTTP errors pass through

- **WHEN** the upstream returns an HTTP response (including 429/503)
- **THEN** the shim forwards it without retrying

#### Scenario: Direct Anthropic failure does not wait for local recovery

- **WHEN** an auxiliary request routed directly to Anthropic fails before an HTTP response
- **THEN** the shim surfaces the direct connection failure once
- **AND** does not apply the agent-lb restart backoff

#### Scenario: Launcher-owned proxy follows parent lifetime

- **WHEN** the launcher starts an ephemeral proxy for one Claude Code session
- **THEN** the proxy binds an operating-system-selected loopback port
- **AND** exits after its parent launcher process exits

#### Scenario: Shared proxy has no parent watcher

- **WHEN** launchd starts the proxy in shared mode with an explicit port
- **THEN** the proxy binds only that loopback port
- **AND** remains available until launchd stops it
