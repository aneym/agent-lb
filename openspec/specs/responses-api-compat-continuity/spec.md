# responses-api-compat-continuity Specification

## Purpose

Define previous-response continuity, session affinity and websocket error recovery contracts. Entry capability: [responses-api-compat](../responses-api-compat/spec.md).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Single HTTP bridge previous-response misses recover or fail closed
When an HTTP bridge session receives an anonymous upstream `previous_response_not_found` error for a single pending follow-up request, the service MUST treat the error as an internal continuity-loss signal. It MUST either recover through the existing previous-response rebind path or rewrite the error to a retryable continuity failure instead of forwarding the raw upstream invalid-request error.

#### Scenario: single pending HTTP bridge follow-up loses previous-response continuity
- **WHEN** an HTTP `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` bridge session has exactly one pending request with `previous_response_id`
- **AND** upstream emits `previous_response_not_found` without a `response.id`
- **THEN** the service attempts the existing previous-response recovery path
- **AND** if recovery is unavailable, it emits a retryable continuity failure for that request
- **AND** the downstream error code is not `previous_response_not_found`

### Requirement: WebSocket full-resend previous-response misses retry without stale anchor
When a direct WebSocket `response.create` request includes both `previous_response_id` and a full resend payload, the service MUST retain a safe replay body without `previous_response_id`. If upstream rejects the anchor with `previous_response_not_found` before `response.created`, the service MUST reconnect and replay the retained full payload as a fresh turn instead of forwarding the raw upstream invalid-request error.

#### Scenario: full-resend WebSocket follow-up loses just-completed anchor
- **WHEN** a WebSocket `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` follow-up has `previous_response_id`
- **AND** the request payload also carries enough input to be treated as a full resend
- **AND** upstream emits `previous_response_not_found` before assigning a response id
- **THEN** the service reconnects the upstream WebSocket
- **AND** it replays the same request without `previous_response_id`
- **AND** the downstream client receives the recovered response events, not the raw `previous_response_not_found` error

### Requirement: Public Responses errors mask previous-response misses
Public Responses endpoints MUST NOT return an OpenAI-shaped `previous_response_not_found` error to clients. If a lower layer still raises or collects that error, the API layer MUST rewrite it to a retryable `stream_incomplete` continuity failure and remove the missing response id from the public payload.

#### Scenario: API layer receives an upstream previous-response miss
- **WHEN** a public `/responses`, `/v1/responses`, `/responses/compact`, or `/v1/responses/compact` handler receives an error with `code=previous_response_not_found`
- **OR** it receives `code=invalid_request_error` with `param=previous_response_id` and a message saying the previous response was not found
- **THEN** the response status is retryable
- **AND** the public error code is `stream_incomplete`
- **AND** the missing `previous_response_id` is not exposed in the response body

### Requirement: Continuity-dependent Responses follow-ups fail closed with retryable errors
When a Responses follow-up depends on previously established continuity state, the service MUST return a retryable continuity error if that continuity cannot be reconstructed safely. The service MUST NOT expose raw `previous_response_not_found` for bridge-local metadata loss or similar internal continuity gaps.

#### Scenario: HTTP bridge loses local continuity metadata for a follow-up request
- **WHEN** an HTTP `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` follow-up request depends on `previous_response_id` or a hard continuity turn-state
- **AND** the bridge cannot reconstruct the matching live continuity state from local or durable metadata
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** the error code is not `previous_response_not_found`

### Requirement: Hard continuity owner lookup fails closed
When a request depends on hard continuity ownership, the service MUST fail closed if owner or ring lookup errors prevent safe pinning. The service MUST NOT continue with local recovery or account selection that bypasses hard owner enforcement.

#### Scenario: websocket previous-response owner lookup errors
- **WHEN** a websocket or HTTP fallback follow-up request includes `previous_response_id`
- **AND** owner lookup errors prevent the proxy from determining the required owner account
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** it does not continue the request on an unpinned account

#### Scenario: bridge owner or ring lookup errors for hard continuity keys
- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge request uses a hard continuity key such as turn-state, explicit session affinity, or `previous_response_id`
- **AND** owner or ring lookup errors prevent the proxy from proving the correct bridge owner
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** it does not create or recover a local bridge session on the current replica

### Requirement: Codex backend session_id preserves account affinity
When a backend Codex Responses or compact request includes a non-empty accepted session header, the service MUST use that value as the routing affinity key for upstream account selection. If the request lacks a client-supplied `prompt_cache_key`, the service MUST derive and attach a stable `prompt_cache_key` before upstream forwarding so account affinity and upstream prompt-cache routing can coexist. Accepted session headers are `session_id`, `x-codex-session-id`, and `x-codex-conversation-id`, in that priority order.

#### Scenario: Backend Codex request derives prompt_cache_key before codex-session routing
- **WHEN** `/backend-api/codex/responses` is called with `session_id` and without `prompt_cache_key`
- **THEN** the routing decision still uses durable `codex_session` affinity for account selection
- **AND** the forwarded upstream payload includes a derived stable `prompt_cache_key`

### Requirement: HTTP Responses routes preserve upstream websocket session continuity
When serving HTTP `/v1/responses` or HTTP `/backend-api/codex/responses`, the service MUST preserve upstream Responses websocket session continuity on a stable per-session bridge key instead of opening a brand new upstream session for every eligible request. The bridge key MUST use an explicit session/conversation header when present; otherwise it MUST use normalized `prompt_cache_key`, and when the client omits `prompt_cache_key` the service MUST derive a stable key from the same cache-affinity inputs already used for OpenAI prompt-cache routing. While bridged, the service MUST preserve the external HTTP/SSE contract, MUST continue request logging with `transport = "http"`, and MUST keep requests from different bridge keys isolated from one another.

#### Scenario: bridge forwards hard continuity keys to the owner replica
- **WHEN** operators configure multiple eligible bridge instance ids
- **AND** a request uses a bridge key derived from `x-codex-turn-state` or an explicit session header
- **AND** that request lands on a non-owner instance
- **THEN** the service MUST forward the request internally to the owner replica
- **AND** it MUST NOT return a topology-bearing `bridge_instance_mismatch` error to the client for that owner mismatch alone

#### Scenario: gateway-style prompt-cache bridge requests tolerate wrong-replica arrival
- **WHEN** a request uses a bridge key derived only from `prompt_cache_key` or a derived prompt-cache key
- **AND** that request lands on a non-owner instance
- **THEN** the service MAY create or reuse a local bridge session on that instance
- **AND** it MUST treat the owner mismatch as a locality miss instead of a continuity failure

#### Scenario: forwarded bridge requests fail closed when owner forwarding loops
- **WHEN** a forwarded hard-continuity bridge request reaches another non-owner replica
- **THEN** the service MUST fail the request with a generic 5xx bridge-forward error
- **AND** it MUST NOT attempt another owner handoff

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket top-level previous-response errors are masked
When serving the Codex-native `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket route, the proxy MUST treat upstream `type: "error"` frames with top-level error fields as upstream error envelopes if the frame does not contain a nested `error` object. If those fields describe a `previous_response_not_found` continuity miss, the proxy MUST use the existing continuity fail-closed behavior and MUST NOT forward raw `previous_response_not_found` or the missing response id to the downstream Codex client.

#### Scenario: ChatGPT backend emits top-level previous-response miss on Codex websocket
- **WHEN** a `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket follow-up has `previous_response_id`
- **AND** the ChatGPT backend emits `{"type":"error","code":"previous_response_not_found","param":"previous_response_id",...}` without a nested `error` object
- **THEN** the downstream event is a retryable continuity failure such as `stream_incomplete`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not contain `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not expose the missing previous response id

### Requirement: WebSocket terminal auth failures recover before visible output

When a Codex or OpenAI-compatible Responses WebSocket request receives an upstream terminal `response.failed` or `error` before downstream-visible output with `error.code = "invalid_api_key"` or `error.type = "authentication_error"`, the proxy MUST treat the failure as account-local auth state instead of immediately surfacing the terminal event. The proxy MUST preserve the existing no-replay rule after downstream-visible output or for non-replayable continuation requests.

#### Scenario: Session-ended WebSocket auth failure uses another account

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for a WebSocket `response.create` request
- **AND** the selected account returns a pre-visible terminal auth failure whose message says the session ended or asks the user to log in again
- **WHEN** another eligible account can complete the request
- **THEN** the downstream WebSocket response succeeds from the other account
- **AND** the selected account is marked re-authentication-required and excluded from that replay

#### Scenario: Generic WebSocket auth failure refreshes once before failover

- **GIVEN** at least two accounts are eligible for a WebSocket `response.create` request
- **AND** the selected account returns a pre-visible terminal `invalid_api_key` failure
- **WHEN** the forced-refresh replay on the selected account also returns a pre-visible terminal `invalid_api_key` failure
- **THEN** the proxy excludes the selected account and tries another eligible account
- **AND** the downstream WebSocket response succeeds from the other account when it completes

#### Scenario: WebSocket auth failure after visible output is not replayed

- **GIVEN** a WebSocket response has emitted downstream-visible output
- **WHEN** upstream later returns a terminal `invalid_api_key` or `authentication_error`
- **THEN** the proxy MUST surface the terminal error without replaying the request on another account

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket wrapped errors follow official client shape

When serving `/backend-api/codex/responses` or bridge-backed Responses WebSocket traffic, the service MUST classify upstream `type: "error"` frames using the same wrapped-error shape that the official Codex client accepts: a non-2xx `status` or `status_code` field indicates an upstream HTTP-style error, and the error detail MAY appear either in a nested `error` object or in top-level fields such as `code`, `message`, `param`, and `error_type`.

Top-level error normalization MUST NOT treat the event discriminator `type: "error"` as the upstream error type. If the frame provides `error_type`, the service MUST use that value as the error type for classification/rewrites. Existing continuity protection remains authoritative: frames describing `previous_response_not_found` MUST be rewritten or recovered through the established `stream_incomplete` continuity path instead of exposing the raw upstream code or missing response id.

#### Scenario: status_code alias is classified as upstream error status

- **WHEN** an upstream Codex WebSocket frame is `{"type":"error","status_code":400,...}`
- **THEN** the service treats the HTTP-style error status as `400`
- **AND** applies the same error classification path as for `status: 400`

#### Scenario: top-level error_type is used for classification

- **WHEN** an upstream Codex WebSocket frame is `{"type":"error","status":400,"error_type":"invalid_request_error","code":"previous_response_not_found",...}`
- **THEN** the normalized error detail has `type = "invalid_request_error"`
- **AND** the event discriminator `type = "error"` is not used as the upstream error type

#### Scenario: top-level previous-response miss remains masked

- **WHEN** a `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket follow-up has `previous_response_id`
- **AND** upstream emits a top-level `previous_response_not_found` wrapped-error frame using `status_code`
- **THEN** the downstream event is a retryable continuity failure such as `stream_incomplete`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not contain `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not expose the missing previous response id

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket stale-anchor failures remain recoverable by a full-context retry
When serving or consuming the Codex-native `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket route, upstream `previous_response_id` MUST be treated as an ephemeral optimization rather than durable conversation state. A stale-anchor continuity failure during a long-wait tool-output continuation MUST NOT hard-end the user turn before one full-context retry without `previous_response_id` has been attempted.

#### Scenario: Long-running terminal wait invalidates the upstream previous response anchor
- **GIVEN** a Codex-native WebSocket session has completed a response with id `resp_old`
- **AND** the client later sends a `response.create` frame with `previous_response_id: "resp_old"` and tool-output or other delta input after a long idle period
- **WHEN** the upstream rejects `resp_old` with a stale-anchor error such as `previous_response_not_found`
- **THEN** the failure is classified as stale-anchor continuity loss
- **AND** the client-side recovery path retries once using full conversation history without `previous_response_id` before surfacing a turn-ending error
- **AND** the downstream/user-visible error path does not expose raw `previous_response_not_found` or the missing upstream response id

#### Scenario: agent-lb sanitizes stale-anchor errors for client classification
- **WHEN** upstream emits a direct WebSocket stale-anchor error
- **THEN** agent-lb MUST NOT forward raw `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** agent-lb MUST NOT expose the missing upstream response id downstream
- **AND** agent-lb MUST preserve a stable sanitized classifier that lets a compatible Codex client distinguish stale-anchor continuity loss from quota, policy, auth, and generic invalid-request failures

#### Scenario: Non-stale-anchor failures do not trigger full-context retry
- **WHEN** the upstream failure is quota, policy, auth, context-window, or another non-continuity error
- **THEN** the client MUST NOT convert it into a stale-anchor full-context retry
- **AND** agent-lb MUST preserve the original error class as much as safely possible

### Requirement: Codex WebSocket continuity source of truth is centralized
The behavior for Codex-native WebSocket previous-response continuity MUST be specified in this OpenSpec change rather than route-local or branch-local ad hoc patches. Future changes to this behavior MUST update the OpenSpec requirements before modifying code.

#### Scenario: Previous-response fix changes behavior
- **WHEN** a patch changes routing, replay, masking, retry, or failure behavior for Codex-native WebSocket `previous_response_id`
- **THEN** the patch includes an OpenSpec delta or updates the active continuity source of truth
- **AND** direct `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket tests or Codex client WebSocket tests cover the changed behavior

### Requirement: Direct WebSocket previous-response misses never leak raw upstream errors
When a direct Responses WebSocket request depends on `previous_response_id`, the service MUST NOT send a raw upstream `previous_response_not_found` payload to the downstream client. This applies to `/v1/responses` and `/backend-api/codex/responses` WebSocket clients.

#### Scenario: Codex Desktop continue receives upstream previous-response miss before response.created
- **WHEN** a direct WebSocket `response.create` request includes `previous_response_id`
- **AND** upstream emits a top-level `type=error` payload with `code=previous_response_not_found` or `param=previous_response_id`
- **AND** no stable upstream `response.id` has been assigned yet
- **THEN** the downstream client receives either a transparent replay result or a retryable terminal event
- **AND** the downstream payload does not include `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the downstream payload does not include the missing previous response id

#### Scenario: Codex Desktop continue has only request-log owner metadata
- **WHEN** a prior direct WebSocket turn completed and was persisted only in `request_logs`
- **AND** a later direct WebSocket follow-up references that completed response id
- **THEN** owner lookup uses request-log metadata or fails closed with a retryable error
- **AND** it does not continue on an unpinned account
- **AND** it does not expose raw `previous_response_not_found`
