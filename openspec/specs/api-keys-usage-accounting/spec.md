# api-keys-usage-accounting Specification

## Purpose

Define API key cost accounting, model pricing and usage reporting contracts. Entry capability: [api-keys](../api-keys/spec.md).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Cost accounting uses model and service-tier pricing
When computing API key `cost_usd` usage, the system MUST price requests using the resolved model pricing and the authoritative `service_tier` reported by the upstream response when available, falling back to the forwarded request `service_tier` only when the response omits it. Requests sent with non-standard service tiers MUST use the published pricing for the tier actually used instead of falling back to standard-tier pricing.

#### Scenario: Priority-tier request increments cost limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for a priced model is finalized with `service_tier: "priority"`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the priority-tier rate for that model

#### Scenario: Flex-tier request increments cost limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for a priced model is finalized with `service_tier: "flex"`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the flex-tier rate for that model

#### Scenario: Standard-tier request keeps standard pricing
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for the same model is finalized without `service_tier`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the standard-tier rate

### Requirement: gpt-5.4 pricing is recognized
The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.4` pricing when computing request costs. For standard-tier requests with more than 272K input tokens, the system MUST apply the published higher long-context rates.

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4 request priced at standard tier
- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4` completes with standard service tier
- **THEN** the system computes non-zero cost using the configured `gpt-5.4` standard rates

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4 long-context request priced at long-context rates
- **WHEN** a standard-tier `gpt-5.4` request completes with more than 272K input tokens
- **THEN** the system computes cost using the configured long-context `gpt-5.4` rates

### Requirement: gpt-5.4-mini pricing is recognized

The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.4-mini` pricing when computing request costs. Snapshot aliases for the same model family MUST resolve to the canonical `gpt-5.4-mini` price table entry.

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4-mini request priced at standard tier

- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4-mini` completes with standard service tier
- **THEN** the system computes non-zero cost using the configured `gpt-5.4-mini` standard rates

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4-mini snapshot request priced at canonical rates

- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17` completes
- **THEN** the system resolves the snapshot alias to `gpt-5.4-mini`
- **AND** the system applies the same standard rates

### Requirement: API keys can read their own `/v1/usage`

The system SHALL expose `GET /v1/usage` for self-service usage lookup by API-key clients. The route MUST require a valid API key in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer authentication scheme even when `api_key_auth_enabled` is false globally. The response MUST include only data for the authenticated key and MUST return:

- `request_count`
- `total_tokens`
- `cached_input_tokens`
- `total_cost_usd`
- `limits[]` containing only limits configured on the authenticated API key, with `limit_type`, `limit_window`, `max_value`, `current_value`, `remaining_value`, `model_filter`, `reset_at`, and `source`
- `upstream_limits[]` containing aggregate upstream Codex credit windows when available, with the same fields and `source: "aggregate"`

Validation failures MUST use the existing OpenAI error envelope used by `/v1/*` routes.

#### Scenario: Missing API key is rejected

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/usage` without a Bearer token
- **THEN** the system returns 401 in the OpenAI error format

#### Scenario: Invalid API key is rejected

- **WHEN** a client calls `GET /v1/usage` with an unknown, expired, or inactive Bearer key
- **THEN** the system returns 401 in the OpenAI error format

#### Scenario: Key with no usage returns zero totals

- **WHEN** a valid API key with no request-log usage calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **THEN** the system returns `request_count: 0`, `total_tokens: 0`, `cached_input_tokens: 0`, `total_cost_usd: 0.0`

#### Scenario: Usage is scoped to the authenticated key

- **WHEN** multiple API keys have request-log history and one of them calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **THEN** the response includes only the usage totals and limits for that authenticated key

#### Scenario: Upstream limits are separate from API-key limits

- **WHEN** an API key with its own limit calls `GET /v1/usage`
- **AND** upstream Codex aggregate usage data exists
- **THEN** `limits[]` contains the API-key limit values
- **AND** `upstream_limits[]` contains the aggregate Codex credit windows

#### Scenario: Self-usage works while global proxy auth is disabled

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false and a client calls `GET /v1/usage` with a valid Bearer key
- **THEN** the system still authenticates that key and returns the self-usage payload

### Requirement: API key cost accounting uses the billable service tier
API key cost accounting MUST continue to use the effective billable `service_tier` chosen for the request log and MUST NOT derive pricing from the operator-requested tier when the upstream reports a different actual tier.

#### Scenario: Requested and actual tiers differ
- **WHEN** a priced request is sent with `requested_service_tier: "priority"`
- **AND** the upstream reports `actual_service_tier: "default"`
- **THEN** the persisted billable `service_tier` is `default`
- **AND** API key cost accounting uses the `default` tier rate for that request

### Requirement: API key list includes pooled credit data

The `GET /api/api-keys/` list endpoint SHALL include per-key pooled credit data computed by aggregating upstream usage across the selectable accounts assigned to each key. When a key has no assigned accounts, the system SHALL pool across all selectable accounts.

Selectable accounts exclude accounts whose status is `paused` or `deactivated`, matching load-balancer routing eligibility.

The response SHALL include `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` (float or null), `pooled_remaining_percent_secondary` (float or null), and `pooled_capacity_credits_primary` (float, default 0.0) on each key object.

When `pooled_capacity_credits_primary` is 0.0 (e.g., all assigned accounts are free-tier), `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` SHALL be null.

#### Scenario: Scoped key pools assigned accounts only

- **WHEN** an API key has `assignedAccountIds` containing two accounts
- **AND** those accounts have usage data
- **THEN** `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` and `pooled_remaining_percent_secondary` reflect only those two accounts

#### Scenario: Unscoped key pools all accounts

- **WHEN** an API key has `assignedAccountIds` = []
- **THEN** pooled credit fields reflect all accounts in the system

#### Scenario: Free-tier accounts hide primary bar

- **WHEN** all assigned accounts have plan_type "free" (primary capacity = 0)
- **THEN** `pooled_capacity_credits_primary` = 0.0
- **AND** `pooled_remaining_percent_primary` = null

#### Scenario: Paused and deactivated accounts are excluded

- **WHEN** an API key has assigned accounts with active and paused statuses
- **THEN** pooled credit fields reflect only the active selectable accounts

### Requirement: API key 7-day usage includes account cost breakdown

`GET /api/api-keys/{key_id}/usage-7d` SHALL return `accountCosts[]` in addition to the existing 7-day totals for the selected API key. Each `accountCosts[]` item SHALL include `accountId`, `email`, `costUsd`, and `isDeleted`.

The system MUST aggregate `accountCosts[]` from request-log rows whose `api_key_id` matches the selected key and whose `requested_at` falls inside the rolling 7-day window used by the endpoint totals.

#### Scenario: Account costs are sorted by descending cost
- **WHEN** a client loads `GET /api/api-keys/{key_id}/usage-7d`
- **AND** multiple grouped account-cost buckets exist in the 7-day window
- **THEN** `accountCosts[]` is ordered by `costUsd` descending

#### Scenario: Unknown account usage remains separate
- **WHEN** request-log rows in the 7-day window have `account_id = NULL`
- **AND** those rows are not soft-deleted
- **THEN** the response includes an `accountCosts[]` item with `accountId: null`, `email: null`, and `isDeleted: false`

#### Scenario: Deleted account usage is grouped into one bucket
- **WHEN** request-log rows in the 7-day window are marked deleted
- **THEN** the response groups their cost into a synthetic `accountCosts[]` item with `accountId: null`, `email: null`, and `isDeleted: true`

#### Scenario: Deleted and unknown account usage stay distinct
- **WHEN** the same API key has both soft-deleted request-log cost and unknown non-deleted request-log cost inside the 7-day window
- **THEN** the response returns separate `accountCosts[]` items for the deleted and non-deleted buckets

### Requirement: API key 7-day account-cost queries use a composite request-log index

The database SHALL provide an index that supports filtering request logs by API key and 7-day requested-at range before grouping by account for the API-key account-cost breakdown.

#### Scenario: Composite account-cost index exists after migration
- **WHEN** database migrations are applied
- **THEN** the `request_logs` table includes an index covering `api_key_id`, descending `requested_at`, and `account_id`
